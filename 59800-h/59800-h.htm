  PICTURE-SHOW<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  And still they come and go: and this is all I know&mdash;<br />
  That from the gloom I watch an endless picture-show,<br />
  Where wild or listless faces flicker on their way,<br />
  With glad or grievous hearts I'll never understand<br />
  Because Time spins so fast, and they've no time to stay<br />
  Beyond the moment's gesture of a lifted hand.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And still, between the shadow and the blinding flame,<br />
  The brave despair of men flings onward, ever the same<br />
  As in those doom-lit years that wait them, and have been...<br />
  And life is just the picture dancing on a screen.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<a id="reconciliation"></a>
  RECONCILIATION<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  When you are standing at your hero's grave,<br />
  Or near some homeless village where he died,<br />
  Remember, through your heart's rekindling pride,<br />
  The German soldiers who were loyal and brave.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Men fought like brutes; and hideous things were done;<br />
  And you have nourished hatred, harsh and blind.<br />
  But in that Golgotha perhaps you'll find<br />
  The mothers of the men who killed your son.<br />
</p>

  CONCERT PARTY<br />
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  (EGYPTIAN BASE CAMP)<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They are gathering round...<br />
  Out of the twilight; over the grey-blue sand,<br />
  Shoals of low-jargoning men drift inward to the sound&mdash;<br />
  The jangle and throb of a piano ... tum-ti-tum...<br />
  Drawn by a lamp, they come<br />
  Out of the glimmering lines of their tents, over the shuffling sand.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O sing us the songs, the songs of our own land,<br />
  You warbling ladies in white.<br />
  Dimness conceals the hunger in our faces,<br />
  This wall of faces risen out of the night,<br />
  These eyes that keep their memories of the places<br />
  So long beyond their sight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Jaded and gay, the ladies sing; and the chap in brown<br />
  Tilts his grey hat; jaunty and lean and pale,<br />
  He rattles the keys....  Some actor-bloke from town...<br />
  God send you home; and then <i>A long, long trail</i>;<br />
  <i>I hear you calling me</i>; and <i>Dixieland</i>....<br />
  Sing slowly ... now the chorus ... one by one<br />
  We hear them, drink them; till the concert's done.<br />
  Silent, I watch the shadowy mass of soldiers stand.<br />
  Silent, they drift away, over the glimmering sand.<br />

  NIGHT ON THE CONVOY<br />
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  (ALEXANDRIA-MARSEILLES)<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Out in the blustering darkness, on the deck<br />
  A gleam of stars looks down.  Long blurs of black,<br />
  The lean Destroyers, level with our track,<br />
  Plunging and stealing, watch the perilous way<br />
  Through backward racing seas and caverns of chill spray.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sentry by the davits, in the gloom<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands mute: the boat heaves onward through the night.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrouded is every chink of cabined light:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sluiced by floundering waves that hiss and boom<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crash like guns, the troop-ship shudders ... doom.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now something at my feet stirs with a sigh;<br />
  And slowly growing used to groping dark,<br />
  I know that the hurricane-deck, down all its length,<br />
  Is heaped and spread with lads in sprawling strength&mdash;<br />
  Blanketed soldiers sleeping.  In the stark<br />
  Danger of life at war, they lie so still,<br />
  All prostrate and defenceless, head by head...<br />
  And I remember Arras, and that hill<br />
  Where dumb with pain I stumbled among the dead.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We are going home.  The troopship, in a thrill<br />
  Of fiery-chamber'd anguish, throbs and rolls.<br />
  We are going home ... victims ... three thousand souls.<br />

  THE DUG-OUT<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Why do you lie with your legs ungainly huddled,<br />
  And one arm bent across your sullen, cold,<br />
  Exhausted face?  It hurts my heart to watch you,<br />
  Deep-shadow'd from the candle's guttering gold;<br />
  And you wonder why I shake you by the shoulder;<br />
  Drowsy, you mumble and sigh and turn your head....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>You are too young to fall asleep for ever;<br />
  And when you sleep you remind me of the dead</i>.<br />

  BATTALION-RELIEF<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  '<i>Fall in!  Now get a move on.</i>'  (Curse the rain.)<br />
  We splash away along the straggling village,<br />
  Out to the flat rich country, green with June....<br />
  And sunset flares across wet crops and tillage,<br />
  Blazing with splendour-patches.  (Harvest soon,<br />
  Up in the Line.)  '<i>Perhaps the War'll be done<br />
  'By Christmas-Day.  Keep smiling then, old son.</i>'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Here's the Canal: it's dusk; we cross the bridge.<br />
  'Lead on there, by platoons.'  (The Line's a-glare<br />
  With shellfire through the poplars; distant rattle<br />
  Of rifles and machine-guns.)  '<i>Fritz is there!<br />
  'Christ, ain't it lively, Sergeant?  Is't a battle?</i>'<br />
  More rain: the lightning blinks, and thunder rumbles.<br />
  '<i>There's over-head artillery!</i>' some chap grumbles.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What's all this mob at the cross-roads?  Where are the guides?...<br />
  'Lead on with number One.'  And off they go.<br />
  'Three minute intervals.'  (Poor blundering files,<br />
  Sweating and blindly burdened; who's to know<br />
  If death will catch them in those two dark miles?)<br />
  More rain.  'Lead on, Head-quarters.'  (That's the lot.)<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  '<i>Who's that? ... Oh, Sergeant-Major, don't get shot!<br />
  'And tell me, have we won this war or not!</i>'<br />

  IN AN UNDERGROUND DRESSING-STATION
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Quietly they set their burden down: he tried<br />
  To grin; moaned; moved his head from side to side.<br />
  * * * * * * *<br />
  He gripped the stretcher; stiffened; glared; and screamed,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'O put my leg down, doctor, do!'  (He'd got<br />
  A bullet in his ankle; and he'd been shot<br />
  Horribly through the guts.)  The surgeon seemed<br />
  So kind and gentle, saying, above that crying,<br />
  'You must keep still, my lad.'  But he was dying.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="stood"></a>
  I STOOD WITH THE DEAD<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I stood with the Dead, so forsaken and still:<br />
  When dawn was grey I stood with the Dead.<br />
  And my slow heart said, 'You must kill, you must kill:<br />
  'Soldier, soldier, morning is red.'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  On the shapes of the slain in their crumpled disgrace,<br />
  I stared for a while through the thin cold rain....<br />
  'O lad that I loved, there is rain on your face,<br />
  'And your eyes are blurred and sick like the plain.'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I stood with the Dead....  They were dead; they were dead;<br />
  My heart and my head beat a march of dismay:<br />
  And gusts of the wind came dulled by the guns.<br />
  'Fall in!' I shouted; 'Fall in for your pay!'<br />

  (GREAT WAR)<br />

<p class="poem">
  Squire nagged and bullied till I went to fight,<br />
  (Under Lord Derby's Scheme).  I died in hell&mdash;<br />
  (They called it Passchendaele).  My wound was slight,<br />
  And I was hobbling back; and then a shell<br />
  Burst slick upon the duck-boards: so I fell<br />
  Into the bottomless mud, and lost the light.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  At sermon-time, while Squire is in his pew,<br />
  He gives my gilded name a thoughtful stare;<br />
  For, though low down upon the list, I'm there;<br />
  '<i>In proud and glorious memory</i>' ... that's my due.<br />
  Two bleeding years I fought in France, for Squire:<br />
  I suffered anguish that he's never guessed.<br />
  Once I came home on leave: and then went west...<br />
  What greater glory could a man desire?<br />

  ATROCITIES<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  You told me, in your drunken-boasting mood,<br />
  How once you butchered prisoners.  That was good!<br />
  I'm sure you felt no pity while they stood<br />
  Patient and cowed and scared, as prisoners should.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How did you do them in?  Come, don't be shy:<br />
  You know I love to hear how Germans die,<br />
  Downstairs in dug-outs.  'Kamerad!' They cry;<br />
  Then squeal like stoats when bombs begin to fly.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And you?  I know your record.  You went sick<br />

  And lie, you wangled home.  And here you are,<br />
  Still talking big and boozing in a bar.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O thrilling sweet, my joy, when life was free,<br />

  He guided us through scientific spaces<br />

  Time was the rumoured tongues of vanished races,<br />
  And Thought a chartless Age of Ice and Stone.<br />

<p class="poem">
  The story ended.  Then the darkened air<br />
  Flowered as he lit his pipe; an aureole glowed<br />
  Enwreathed with smoke; the moment's match-light showed<br />

  Of gleaming peace swept on behind.  (I mustn't wake.)<br />

<p class="poem">
  And then great clouds gathered and burst in spumes of green<br />
  That plunged into the water; and the sun came out<br />

  O, but the beauty of their freedom made me shout...<br />
  And when I woke I wondered where on earth I'd been.<br />

  I too have longed for children.  Ah, but you must not weep.<br />
  Something I have to whisper as I kneel beside you...<br />
  And you must pray for me before you fall asleep.<br />

  AFTERMATH<br />

<p class="poem">
  <i>Have you forgotten yet?</i> ...<br />
  For the world's events have rumbled on since those gagged days,<br />
  Like traffic checked awhile at the crossing of city-ways:<br />
  And the haunted gap in your mind has filled with thoughts that flow<br />
  Like clouds in the lit heavens of life; and you're a man<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reprieved to go,<br />
  Taking your peaceful share of Time, with joy to spare.<br />
  <i>But the past is just the same&mdash;and War's a bloody game...<br />
  Have you forgotten yet? ...<br />
  Look down, and swear by the slain of the War that<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll never forget.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Do you remember the dark months you held the sector at Mametz&mdash;<br />
  The nights you watched and wired and dug and piled<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sandbags on parapets?<br />
  Do you remember the rats; and the stench<br />
  Of corpses rotting in front of the front-line trench&mdash;<br />
  And dawn coming, dirty-white, and chill with a hopeless rain?<br />
  Do you ever stop and ask, 'Is it all going to happen again?'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Do you remember that hour of din before the attack&mdash;<br />
  And the anger, the blind compassion that seized and shook you then<br />
  As you peered at the doomed and haggard faces of your men?<br />
  Do you remember the stretcher-cases lurching back<br />
  With dying eyes and lolling heads&mdash;those ashen-grey<br />
  Masks of the lads who once were keen and kind and gay?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Have you forgotten yet? ...<br />
  Look up, and swear by the green of the spring that<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll never forget.</i><br />

  FALLING ASLEEP<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Voices moving about in the quiet house:<br />
  Thud of feet and a muffled shutting of doors:<br />
  Everyone yawning ... only the clocks are alert.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Out in the night there's autumn-smelling gloom<br />
  Crowded with whispering trees,&mdash;looming of oaks<br />
  That roared in wild wet gales: across the park<br />
  The hollow cry of hounds like lonely bells:<br />
  And I know that the clouds are moving across the moon,<br />
  The low, red, rising moon.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The herons call<br />
  And wrangle by their pool; and hooting owls<br />
  Sail from the wood across pale stocks of wheat.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Waiting for sleep, I drift from thoughts like these;<br />
  And where to-day was dream-like, build my dreams.<br />
  Music ... there was a bright white room below,<br />
  And someone singing a song about a soldier,&mdash;<br />
  One hour, two hours ago; and soon the song<br />
  Will be 'last night': but now the beauty swings<br />
  Across my brain, ghost of remember'd chords<br />
  Which still can make such radiance in my dream<br />
  That I can watch the marching of my soldiers,<br />
  And count their faces; faces; sunlit faces.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Falling asleep ... the herons, and the hounds...<br />
  September in the darkness; and the world<br />
  I've known; all fading past me into peace.<br />

<p class="poem">
  You like my bird-sung gardens: wings and flowers;<br />
  Calm landscapes for emotion; star-lit lawns;<br />
  And Youth against the sun-rise ...  '<i>Not profound;</i><br />
  '<i>But such a haunting music in the sound:</i><br />
  '<i>Do it once more; it helps us to forget.</i>'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Last night I dreamt an old recurring scene&mdash;<br />
  Some complex out of childhood; (sex, of course!)<br />
  I can't remember how the trouble starts;<br />
  And then I'm running blindly in the sun<br />
  Down the old orchard, and there's something cruel<br />
  Chasing me; someone roused to a grim pursuit<br />
  Of clumsy anger ...  Crash!  I'm through the fence<br />
  And thrusting wildly down the wood that's dense<br />
  With woven green of safety; paths that wind<br />
  Moss-grown from glade to glade; and far behind,<br />
  One thwarted yell; then silence.  I've escaped.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That's where it used to stop.  Last night I went<br />
  Onward until the trees were dark and huge,<br />
  And I was lost, cut off from all return<br />
  By swamps and birdless jungles.  I'd no chance<br />
  Of getting home for tea.  I woke with shivers,<br />
  And thought of crocodiles in crawling rivers.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Some day I'll build (more ruggedly than Doughty)<br />
  A dark tremendous song you'll never hear.<br />
  My beard will be a snow-storm, drifting whiter<br />
  On bowed, prophetic shoulders, year by year.<br />
  And some will say, 'His work has grown so dreary.'<br />
  Others, 'He used to be a charming writer.'<br />
  And you, my friend, will query&mdash;<br />
  'Why can't you cut it short, you pompous blighter?'<br />

  Begin: your mind's the room where you must sleep,<br />
  (Don't pause for rhymes), till twilight wakes you early.<br />
  The window stands wide-open, as it stood<br />

  Hearing the dawn's first thrushes through the wood<br />
  Warbling (you know the words) serene and wild.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've said it all before: you dreamed of Death,<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some chap shouts, 'Here, stop it; that's been done!'&mdash;<br />

  Go on, whoever you are; your lines can be<br />

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
